      <td> Me: I've created this webpage where you can design your own Jack-O-Lantern. 
        Hopefully it's kind of fun! I've used arrays, for loops, if/else statements, 
        and a switch statement all inside various functions. No information is needed 
        to use the site. 
        <div class="profComment">Professor: "very good job. You had a very creative example there 
        to use arrays and javascript." </div></td>

      <td>10/2/19</td>
      <td>Me: This page uses constructor functions to create 2 new objects and calls 
        certain functions every time you click on a picture. #1-an Apostle object that 
        displays info about the person. #2-a Talk object that displays info about their 
        talk. No info is needed to use the site. 
        <div class="profComment">Professor: "this is great example. very well done!"</div></td>

      <td>10/9/19</td>
      <td>Me: Birthday Calendar: If you don't choose a month and date from the "Date" box 
        OR a name from the "Name" box, you will get an error message. Date box: Try 
        October/See All for lots of birthdays; Try May 12 for multiple birthdays on one 
        day; Try any November date for a no birthday message; Try July 7 for a single 
        birthday. You can see details for a person by either clicking on their name in the 
        date results table or by selecting their name from the "Name" box dropdown.  You 
        can add or delete gifts for a person, and it will be saved throughout the session. 
        If you refresh the page, these changes will be lost.  You have my permission to 
        share this assignment.

      <td>10/11/19</td>
      <td>Me: Country Search: Type the name of a country (exact spelling is needed, including accents). An AJAX call to a 3rd party will 
        retrieve information and display it for the user. AJAX calls to 2 local files will 
        convert currency and language codes into names. Case in the search bar does not 
        matter as everything is converted to lower case for simple comparison. Alternate 
        spellings are allowed if included in the response JSON (United States vs USA). An 
        error message will be displayed if the country is not found or if the search bar is 
        left blank. You have my permission to share this assignment.

      <td><a href="/Assignments/localStorage.html" target="_blank">Local Storage</a></td>
      <td>11/5/19</td>
      <td>Me: Birthday Calendar: I reused the assignment for JSON, but I added Local Storage. 
        When the page is loaded, the birthday JSON is saved to local storage which includes 
        each person's name, birthday, and gift ideas. Displaying a person's information will 
        access the local storage. Each time a gift is added or deleted from a person's name, 
        the local storage is updated. Now, the gift list will be saved even after refreshing 
        the page. Date box: Try October/See All for lots of birthdays; Try May 12 for multiple 
        birthdays on one day; Try any November date for a no birthday message; Try July 7 for 
        a single birthday. You can see details for a person by either clicking on their name 
        in the date results table or by selecting their name from the "Name" box dropdown. You
